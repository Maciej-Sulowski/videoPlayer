# Video Player

This project is a video player with some cool features!

### Installing

Side note: The project 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. This will install all the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

2. This command will run a http server in your browser and it will also compile/minify typescript and SASS:

```
npm run watch
```

3. There was an issue with webpack dev server which is not fixed yet so temporarily I recommend to use lite server:

```
npm i -g lite server
```

4. Run lite server:

```
lite-server
```
